# Simple Chatbot using Open-Source LLMs

This project demonstrates how to create a simple chatbot using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with Python and Hugging Face.

## Learning Outcomes
By working through this project, you will:
- Understand the main components of a chatbot
- Learn about LLMs and how to choose one for your application
- Gain insights into how transformers work
- Learn about tokenization and feeding input into transformers
- Implement your own chatbot using Python

## Requirements
Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive execution)
- Required Python libraries (install using the command below)

```

## Usage
Run the chatbot notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook CB.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to interact with the chatbot.

## Technologies Used
